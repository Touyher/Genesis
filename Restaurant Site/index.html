      <p>Come one come all to High 5 Sports Bar. This is the place where you want to come to relax.
      We have savory foods made from our five-star chef, Bob Cooker, featured on the television show
      Bronze Chef. Choose from traditional meals such as burgers or hotdogs or try the fan favorite
      Italian Sausage and Peppers.  Whatever you choose, you'll be making the right choice.
      We have free arcade machines for the kids, pool
      tables for the "cool" kids, and a great happy hour for the adults.
